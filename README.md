# Image-Colourization-Using-Autoencoders
This project focuses on image colorization â€“ the task of automatically adding color to grayscale images using deep learning. The model is built with an autoencoder architecture, where the encoder extracts meaningful features from grayscale images, and the decoder reconstructs them into colorized images.
